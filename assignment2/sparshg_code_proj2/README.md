# Instructions to run my submission for Assignment 2

## For Q1.1, 1.2, 1.3 find changes in losses.py, and fit_data.py
So to run the parts of Q1, just run python fit_data.py --type '{}' and input type [vox, mesh, point]

## For Q2.1, 2.2, 2.3, just run python eval_model.py --type '{}' --load_checkpoint.
Same instructions for type.

## Q2.4, 2.5, 2.6 are there in the webpage

## Q3.2 is in model.py itself
So same instruction to run as for Q2.1.
